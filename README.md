Materials for Arduino and Wearables Workshop

Please feel free to use these materials as long as you give credit to and reference the source, and keep all the contact information and reference links and images on the materials. If you would like to learn how to become an instructor, contribute to the materials, or to hold a workshop for an organization or an institution, please contact electroNat.wearables@gmail.com

I use a lot of reference materials from Adafruit and credit for all of those goes to Adafruit, Inc. and Lady Ada :)

This workshop consists of a 3-hr morning session (Arduino) and a 3-hr afternoon session (Wearables).

The morning session of this workhshop introduces participants to key circuits and code concepts through a combination of mini-lessons (presentation) and hands-on activities. The participants will build our the first 4 projects in the Official Arduino Starter Kit: https://www.amazon.com/Arduino-Starter-Kit-English-Official/dp/B009UKZV0A. As they work through the projects, trained Teaching Assistants will check in with them, ask them questions (see 'Arduino Workshop Questions.pdf') to encourage thought and learning, and help them debug their circuits and code.

The wearables portion of this workshop utilizes the Adafruit Circuit Playground platform: https://learn.adafruit.com/introducing-circuit-playground/overview. The participants will first be introduced to wearables through a presentation and learn how to work with Adafruit NeoPixel libraries by reprogramming provided tester circuits and the Circuit Playground. They will then assemble their wearable (which they get to keep) and reprogram the Circuit Playground with strandtest. Finally, they will work through code modules that utilize the sensor modules on Circuit Playground and have fun customizing the behavior of their wearable.

The participants will work in pairs throughout the workshop. They will share 1 laptop and 1 Arduino Starter Kit per group, and 1 tester circuit. Every participant will get to keep and program their own Circuit Playground.
